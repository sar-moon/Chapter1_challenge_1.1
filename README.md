Cryptic Message Decoder is a simple and efficient tool designed to decode hidden or encoded messages.
It helps users understand how basic cryptography techniques work in real scenarios.
The project focuses on clarity, learning, and practical implementation.
Users can input an encoded message and select a decoding method.
The system then processes the message and displays the decoded output.
It supports multiple classic cipher techniques.
These techniques are commonly used in beginner-level cryptography.
The project is suitable for students and mini-project submissions.
It uses a clean and modular code structure.
Each cipher is implemented separately for better understanding.
The program is easy to run and does not require complex setup.
It can be executed from the command line.
The logic is written in a beginner-friendly manner.
New decoding methods can be added easily.
